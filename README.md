# üç™ Cookie Clicker (Java)

This project was developed as part of the **CSE 131** course that I took at **Washington University in St. Louis**. The assignment focused on building a simplified version of the popular idle game **Cookie Clicker** using Java and the StdDraw graphics library.

The main objective was to simulate an incremental clicker game where the user clicks on a cookie to earn "cookies" (currency), while also implementing idle earnings and progressive power-ups. This project encouraged students to practice **mouse event handling**, **random drawing**, **real-time logic**, and **prompt engineering with AI tools**.

## üéØ Project Goals

The assignment required the following features:

- **Clickable cookie** drawn on-screen with a "Cookie Clicker!" title.
- **Randomly placed chocolate chips** (5 total) on the cookie that remain fixed throughout the game.
- **Mouse click detection** to increment a cookie counter.
- **Idle cookie generation**, where the player earns cookies automatically every second.
- **Click power-up**: After reaching 20 cookies, each click is worth more (scales with usage and cost increases).
- **Idle power-up**: After reaching 60 cookies, the idle cookie rate increases (also scales).
- Power-ups **automatically trigger** when thresholds are met (no buttons required).
- The game runs **endlessly** and updates the display in real time.
